# SampleASPProject
##About   
This is a .NET project I created to prepare myself for our sample app deliverable for our Senior Project client.   
This follows the tutorial found on: https://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/data/using-web-api-with-entity-framework/part-1   
Displays a collection of Books, and allows the user to view them individually, as well as make new books. It uses RESTful style Web API layer and uses the MVVM architecture. It is responsive and does asyncronous loading.
